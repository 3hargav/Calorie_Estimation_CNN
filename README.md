# Calorie_Estimation_CNN
Obesity, the major concern of the present generation. It causes mainly because of the unwillingness of people to keep track of their calorie intake. Various studies had been done to correctly predict the calorie intake without human touch. Here, we propose a new framework using Deep learning to estimate the calories by simply looking at the image provided. Our approach follows the object detection followed by image segmentation technique to estimate the volume of the food and then calculating the approximate calories carried by it.
